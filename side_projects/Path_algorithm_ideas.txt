Idea for path solving algorithm:
Think of the field as a grid
X X X X X X
X X X X X X
X X X X X X
X X X X X X
H
(H is homebase)
1. Start at the bottom left and send drone to the far right
2. Increase y by 1, and bring the drone back to the left
3. Check the remaining battery
4. If the battery is within a certain range, send it back to home base
5. If battery is good, do another down and back, and check the battery again
